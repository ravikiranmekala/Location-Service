Dockerfile1 and docker-compose1.yml are a pair. You can run the project using docker compose up. You need to modify code in database.go at the location where environment variables are being used.
> docker compose up

Dockerfile is for building image of the project and then running the image. for this you need to first run a postgres container using docker-compose-db.yml file.

# Use the Dockerfile and create an image named go-server
> docker build -t go-server .

# To run the image created
> docker run -p 3000:3000 go-server 

# To examine the contents of the image using bash.
> docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh go-server 

# To check all the images
> docker images

# To remove an image
> docker rmi <image_id>

# To remove all the dead containers
> docker container rm $(docker container ls -aq)

# To stop a container
> docker stop
